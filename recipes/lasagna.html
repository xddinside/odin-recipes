        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Lasagna is a beloved Italian comfort dish featuring layers of tender pasta sheets, a rich and savory meat sauce, creamy ricotta cheese filling, and plenty of gooey mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. The recipe typically starts with browning a mixture of ground beef and Italian sausage, then simmering it with tomatoes, tomato paste, and Italian herbs to create a flavorful sauce. Meanwhile, a creamy ricotta mixture is prepared with egg, parsley, and Parmesan for added richness. The dish is assembled by layering the meat sauce, cooked lasagna noodles, and cheese mixture in a baking dish, repeating the layers, and finishing with a generous topping of mozzarella and Parmesan. Baked until bubbly and golden, lasagna is hearty, cheesy, and perfect for feeding a crowd or enjoying as leftovers</p>
