        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Margherita pizza is a classic Italian pizza that celebrates simplicity and fresh flavors. It features a thin, chewy crust topped with a vibrant tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella cheese, and aromatic basil leaves, all drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil. The colors of the toppings—red, white, and green—reflect the Italian flag. This pizza is baked at a high temperature until the crust is golden and crisp and the cheese is bubbling. Finished with a sprinkle of red pepper flakes or black pepper and more fresh basil, Margherita pizza is beloved for its balance of tangy tomato, milky cheese, and fragrant herbs, making it a timeless favorite</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Combine dry ingredients:</strong> Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Activate yeast:</strong> Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast forms a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Make the dough:</strong>  
            <ul>
              <li>Stir half the flour mixture into the yeast mixture until no dry spots remain.</li>
              <li>Gradually stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition.</li>
              <li>When dough pulls together, turn it onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          
          <li><strong>First rise:</strong> Lightly oil a large bowl, place dough inside, and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95°F / 27 to 35°C) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Divide dough:</strong> Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form each into a ball.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Preheat oven:</strong> Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500°F (260°C).</li>
          
          <li><strong>Shape and top pizzas:</strong>  
            <ul>
              <li>Stretch and pat 1 dough ball into a 10 to 12-inch circle.</li>
              <li>Place dough on a lightly floured pizza peel.</li>
              <li>Spread 1/2 cup tomato sauce, leaving about 1 inch from the edge.</li>
              <li>Arrange 5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
              <li>Place 5 basil leaves over the cheese.</li>
              <li>Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste.</li>
              <li>Repeat for remaining dough balls.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          
          <li><strong>Bake pizzas:</strong> Slide each pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake until cheese is bubbly and crust underside is golden brown, about 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
